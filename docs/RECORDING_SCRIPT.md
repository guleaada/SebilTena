# MedaGuard — Native Speaker Recording Script

**Version 1.1** (addendum folded in): added the `hazard_unlikely` clip (§2), and
the nine `aid_*` first-aid clips (§3) are now used for **every** product, known
or unknown — they are the highest-priority recordings. See the priority order at
the end.

**Purpose:** These are all the phrases MedaGuard speaks aloud to farmers. Recording them once per language gives us perfect pronunciation, full offline operation, and coverage for languages no text-to-speech provider supports.

**Languages needed:** Amharic · Afaan Oromo · Sidaamu Afoo · Tigrinya · Somali · Wolaytta

> This file is the **canonical phrase-key inventory**. The app requests audio by
> exactly these `key`s (`public/js/audio.js`, resolving `/audio/{lang}/{key}.{fmt}`),
> and `scripts/gen-audio-placeholders.js` generates the English placeholders from
> this same list. Add/rename a key here and in the generator together.

## Instructions for the recorder

- **One audio file per phrase.** Filename = the `key` column exactly, e.g. `verdict_verified.mp3`.
- **Folder per language**, using these codes: `am` (Amharic), `om` (Afaan Oromo), `sid` (Sidaamu Afoo), `ti` (Tigrinya), `so` (Somali), `wal` (Wolaytta).
- **Phone recording is fine.** Quiet room, phone ~20cm from mouth, no music, no background voices.
- **Speak clearly and calmly**, slightly slower than normal conversation. A frightened farmer is listening.
- **Leave ~0.5s of silence** at the start and end of each clip.
- **The English column is a meaning guide, not a script to translate literally.** Say it the way a trusted extension agent would say it to a farmer in the field. Natural beats literal.
- **Emergency phrases (Section 3) are the top priority.** If time is short, record those first.

## 3. EMERGENCY — record these first

|---|---|
| `emergency_title` | Emergency. Poisoning help. |
| `emergency_ask_route` | How did the poison touch the person? |
| `route_skin` | On the skin |

### First-aid steps — used for EVERY product (record these with the most care)

These nine `aid_*` clips are **the most important recordings in the entire
project** — they are what a person hears when someone has been poisoned. The app
builds each product's first-aid instructions by playing these same nine clips in
the right order for the chemical involved (and it uses them for unknown products
too). Please record them **calm, clear, and unhurried — the way you would speak
to a frightened neighbour.**

| key | Meaning to convey |
|---|---|
| `aid_move_air` | Move the person to fresh air, away from the chemical. |
| `aid_remove_clothes` | Remove any clothing that has the chemical on it. |
| `aid_rinse_skin` | Rinse the skin with clean running water for twenty minutes. |
| `aid_rinse_eyes` | Rinse the eyes with clean running water for twenty minutes. Keep the eye open. |
| `aid_do_not_vomit` | Do not make the person vomit. |
| `aid_no_food_drink` | Do not give food or drink. |
| `aid_keep_container` | Keep the pesticide container to show the health worker. |
| `aid_seek_help` | Take the person to a health centre immediately. |
| `aid_if_unconscious` | If the person is not awake, lay them on their side and get help immediately. |

## 4. Numbers & units (for speaking doses and waiting periods)

Record each number **on its own**, as a single spoken word.

- `num_0` through `num_20` — zero, one, two … twenty
- `num_30`, `num_40`, `num_50`, `num_60`, `num_70`, `num_80`, `num_90`, `num_100`
- `point` — the decimal separator (as in "two **point** five")
- `unit_ml_per_litre` — millilitres per litre
- `unit_g_per_litre` — grams per litre
- `unit_kg_per_hectare` — kilograms per hectare
- `unit_l_per_hectare` — litres per hectare
- `unit_ml_per_knapsack` — millilitres per knapsack sprayer

> Numbers 21–99 are composed from tens + ones (e.g. 45 = `num_40` + `num_5`),
> so only 0–20 and the tens need recording. Decimals use `point` + a single
> digit (`num_0`–`num_9`).
